This repository demonstrates a common error in Hack programming: improper function definition. The example shows three simple functions (`foo`, `bar`, `baz`) that should work together to produce a simple calculation. However, if there are errors in the definition of any of the functions (e.g., incorrect return type, incorrect parameter types, missing functions), then the program may not compile or produce unexpected results. The `bug.hack` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.hack` contains the corrected code.
